# python-refresher

Generated a get_column function to source fires from the Agrofood csv file. 
The function allows the user to sort fires by country (or in theory any other parameter), 
and outputs an array that contains fires associated with that value. Parameters are defined
in the print_fires script. The function has two steps. 
The first step takes the file and sorts each line into its own array, 
and compiles those into a larger array called array_con. 
The second portion iterates through each array by the user-defined 
query value and outputs the values in the corresponding results column, 
printed as a new array. 
The first iteration of thisdemanded that the user define the desired results column, 
the second iteration sets the results column to 1 automatically.
